# Verify Useful Data
## Tools: Images from Hubble
### What to consider
1. Calculate appropriate FOV:
- Distance to the SN to get parallax, $P = {1 \over distance}$
It's in M85, distance of 15.8 +1.4/-1.3 Mpc (Williams, S. C., et al.)

- Hubble Untertainty
2. How far back in time should I trace for the pre-explosion images?
